Fun facts:
* I play the [bagpipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uilleann_pipes), [penny whistle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_whistle), and a load of other instruments. I also briefly studied opera singing.
* I like to hack on [programming languages](https://github.com/Sourceless/wizard) in my spare time, especially ones with [silly type systems](https://nlab-pages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nlab/show/cubical+type+theory).
* I have two fluffy white cats: one large, and one small.
* I keep telling myself that I'll actually finish and release a video game one day, but we all know that isn't going to happen.
